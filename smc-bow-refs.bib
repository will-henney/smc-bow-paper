                  science instruments on the Spitzer Space
                  Telescope. The IRS comprises four separate
                  spectrograph modules covering the wavelength range
                  from 5.3 to 38 μm with spectral resolutions,
                  R=λ/∆λ~90 and 600, and it was optimized to take full
                  advantage of the very low background in the space
                  environment. The IRS is performing at or better than
                  the prelaunch predictions. An autonomous target
                  acquisition capability enables the IRS to locate the
                  mid-infrared centroid of a source, providing the
                  information so that the spacecraft can accurately
                  offset that centroid to a selected slit. This
                  feature is particularly useful when taking spectra
                  of sources with poorly known coordinates. An
                  automated data-reduction pipeline has been developed
                  at the Spitzer Science Center. The IRS was a
                  collaborative venture between Cornell University and
                  Ball Aerospace Corporation funded by NASA through
                  the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Ames Research

                  excitation collision strengths for the
                  astrophysically important lines in S II. The
                  collision strengths have been calculated in the
                  close-coupling approximation using the B-spline
                  Breit-Pauli R-matrix method. The multiconfiguration
                  Hartree-Fock method with term-dependent
                  non-orthogonal orbitals is employed for an accurate
                  representation of the target wave functions. The
                  close-coupling expansion includes 70 bound levels of
                  S II covering all possible terms of the ground 3s
                  <SUP>2</SUP>3p <SUP>3</SUP> and singly excited 3s3p
                  <SUP>4</SUP>, 3s <SUP>2</SUP>3p <SUP>2</SUP>3d, 3s
                  <SUP>2</SUP>3p <SUP>2</SUP>4s, and 3s <SUP>2</SUP>3p
                  <SUP>2</SUP>4p configurations. The present
                  calculations are more extensive than previous ones,
                  leading to a total 2415 transitions between
                  fine-structure levels. The effective collision
                  strengths are obtained by averaging the electron
                  collision strengths over a Maxwellian distribution
                  of velocities and these are tabulated for all
                  fine-structure transitions at electron temperatures
                  in the range from 5000 to 100,000 K. The present
                  results are compared with a variety of other
                  close-coupling calculations and available
                  experimental data. There is an overall good

                  accurate and extensive results of energy spectra and
                  transition data for the S II, Cl III, and Ar IV
                  ions. These data are useful for understanding and
                  probing physical processes and conditions in various
                  types of astrophysical plasmas. <BR /> Methods: The
                  multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock (MCDHF) and
                  relativistic configuration interaction (RCI)
                  methods, which are implemented in the
                  general-purpose relativistic atomic structure
                  package GRASP2K, are used in the present work. In
                  the RCI calculations the transverse-photon (Breit)
                  interaction, the vacuum polarization, and the
                  self-energy corrections are included. <BR />
                  Results: Energy spectra are presented comprising the
                  134, 87, and 103 lowest states in S II, Cl III, and
                  Ar IV, respectively. Energy levels are in very good
                  agreement with NIST database recommended values and
                  associated with smaller uncertainties than energies
                  from other theoretical computations. Electric dipole
                  (E1), magnetic dipole (M1), and electric quadrupole
                  (E2) transition data are computed between the above
                  states together with the corresponding
                  lifetimes. Based on internal validation, transition
                  rates for the majority of the stronger transitions
                  are estimated to have uncertainties of less than
                  3%. <P />Tables 5-7 are only available at the CDS

  abstract =	 {Analysis of emission lines in gaseous nebulae yields
                  direct measures of physical conditions and chemical
                  abundances and is the cornerstone of nebular
                  astrophysics. Although the physical problem is
                  conceptually simple, its practical complexity can be
                  overwhelming since the amount of data to be analyzed
                  steadily increases; furthermore, results depend
                  crucially on the input atomic data, whose
                  determination also improves each year. To address
                  these challenges we created PyNeb, an innovative
                  code for analyzing emission lines. PyNeb computes
                  physical conditions and ionic and elemental
                  abundances and produces both theoretical and
                  observational diagnostic plots. It is designed to be
                  portable, modular, and largely customizable in
                  aspects such as the atomic data used, the format of
                  the observational data to be analyzed, and the
                  graphical output. It gives full access to the
                  intermediate quantities of the calculation, making
                  it possible to write scripts tailored to the
                  specific type of analysis one wants to carry out. In
                  the case of collisionally excited lines, PyNeb works
                  by solving the equilibrium equations for an n-level
                  atom; in the case of recombination lines, it works
                  by interpolation in emissivity tables. The code
                  offers a choice of extinction laws and ionization
                  correction factors, which can be complemented by
                  user-provided recipes. It is entirely written in the
                  python programming language and uses standard python
                  libraries. It is fully vectorized, making it apt for
                  analyzing huge amounts of data. The code is stable
                  and has been benchmarked against IRAF/NEBULAR. It is
                  public, fully documented, and has already been
                  satisfactorily used in a number of published

                  supernova remnant (SNR) population of the Small
                  Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We measured multiwavelength
                  properties of the SMC SNRs and compare them to those
                  of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) population. <BR
                  /> Methods: This study combines the large dataset of
                  XMM-Newton observations of the SMC, archival and
                  recent radio continuum observations, an optical line
                  emission survey, and new optical spectroscopic
                  observations. We were therefore able to build a
                  complete and clean sample of 19 confirmed and four
                  candidate SNRs. The homogeneous X-ray spectral
                  analysis allowed us to search for SN ejecta and Fe K
                  line emission, and to measure interstellar medium
                  abundances. We estimated the ratio of core-collapse
                  to type Ia supernova rates of the SMC based on the
                  X-ray properties and the local stellar environment
                  of each SNR. <BR /> Results: After the removal of
                  unconfirmed or misclassified objects, and the
                  addition of two newly confirmed SNRs based on
                  multi-wavelength features, we present a final list
                  of 21 confirmed SNRs and two candidates. While no Fe
                  K line is detected even for the brightest and
                  youngest SNR, we find X-ray evidence of SN ejecta in
                  11 SNRs. We estimate a fraction of 0.62-0.92
                  core-collapse supernova for every supernova (90%
                  confidence interval), higher than in the LMC. The
                  difference can be ascribed to the absence of the
                  enhanced star-formation episode in the SMC, which
                  occurred in the LMC 0.5-1.5 Gyr ago. The hot-gas
                  abundances of O, Ne, Mg, and Fe are 0.1-0.2 times
                  solar. Their ratios, with respect to SMC stellar
                  abundances, reflect the effects of dust depletion
                  and partial dust destruction in SNR shocks. We find
                  evidence that the ambient medium probed by SMC SNRs
                  is less disturbed and less dense on average than in
                  the LMC, consistent with the different morphologies
                  of the two galaxies.},

                  by the Spitzer Space Telescope and Herschel Space
                  Observatory, we were able to search 8-250 $\mu$m
                  images in order to identify infrared (IR) emission
                  associated with SMC supernova remnants (SNRs). A
                  valid detection had to correspond with known X-ray,
                  H α, and radio emission from the SNRs. From the 24
                  known SNRs, we made five positive detections with
                  another five possible detections. Two detections are
                  associated with pulsars or pulsar wind nebula, and
                  another three detections are part of the extended
                  nebulous emission from the SNRs. We modelled dust
                  emission where fast moving electrons are predicted
                  to collide and heat dust grains which then radiate
                  in IR. With known distance (62.44 ± 0.47 kpc),
                  measured SNR sizes, electron densities, temperatures
                  from X-ray emission as well as hydrogen densities,
                  the modelling of SMC SNRs is straightforward. If the
                  higher range of hydrogen and electron densities were
                  to be accepted, we would expect almost all SMC SNRs
                  to be detected in the IR, at least at 24 $\mu$m, but
                  the actual detection rate is only 25 per cent. One
                  possible and common explanation for this discrepancy
                  is that small grains have been destroyed by the SNRs
                  shockwave. However, within the uncertainties of
                  hydrogen and electron densities, we find that IR
                  dust emission can be explained reasonably well,
                  without invoking dust destruction. There is no
                  conclusive evidence that SNRs destroy swept-up ISM
                  dust.},

                  range 0.6-3 M<SUB>solar</SUB>, mostly concentrated
                  in the main cluster, but with secondary subclusters

                  all the known extinction curves in the Small and
                  Large Magellanic Clouds (SMC and LMC) with our
                  understanding of the general behavior of Milky Way
                  extinction curves. The R<SUB>V</SUB>-dependent CCM
                  relationship of Cardelli, Clayton, and Mathis and
                  the sample of extinction curves used to derive this
                  relationship are used to describe the general
                  behavior of Milky Way extinction curves. The
                  ultraviolet portion of the SMC and LMC extinction
                  curves are derived from archival IUE data, except
                  for one new SMC extinction curve, which was measured
                  using Hubble Space Telescope Space Telescope Imaging
                  Spectrograph observations. The optical extinction
                  curves are derived from new (for the SMC) and
                  literature UBVRI photometry (for the LMC). The
                  near-infrared extinction curves are calculated
                  mainly from 2MASS photometry supplemented with DENIS
                  and new JHK photometry. For each extinction curve,
                  we give R<SUB>V</SUB>=A(V)/E(B-V) and N(H I) values
                  that probe the same dust column as the extinction
                  curve. We compare the properties of the SMC and LMC
                  extinction curves with the CCM relationship three
                  different ways: each curve by itself, the behavior
                  of extinction at different wavelengths with
                  R<SUB>V</SUB>, and the behavior of the extinction
                  curve Fitzpatrick and Massa fit parameters with
                  R<SUB>V</SUB>. As has been found previously, we find
                  that a small number of LMC extinction curves are
                  consistent with the CCM relationship, but the
                  majority of the LMC and all the SMC curves do not
                  follow the CCM relationship. For the first time, we
                  find that the CCM relationship seems to form a bound
                  on the properties of all the LMC and SMC extinction
                  curves. This result strengthens the picture dust
                  extinction curves exhibit of a continuum of
                  properties between those found in the Milky Way and
                  the SMC bar. Tentative evidence based on the
                  behavior of the extinction curves with dust-to-gas
                  ratio suggests that the continuum of dust extinction
                  curves is possibly caused by the environmental
                  stresses of nearby star formation activity. <P

  abstract =	 {The processing of raw data from modern astronomical
                  instruments is often carried out nowadays using
                  dedicated software, known as pipelines, largely run
                  in automated operation. In this paper we describe
                  the data reduction pipeline of the Multi Unit
                  Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) integral field
                  spectrograph operated at the ESO Paranal
                  Observatory. This spectrograph is a complex machine:
                  it records data of 1152 separate spatial elements on
                  detectors in its 24 integral field
                  units. Efficiently handling such data requires
                  sophisticated software with a high degree of
                  automation and parallelization. We describe the
                  algorithms of all processing steps that operate on
                  calibrations and science data in detail, and explain
                  how the raw science data is transformed into
                  calibrated datacubes. We finally check the quality
                  of selected procedures and output data products, and
                  demonstrate that the pipeline provides datacubes
